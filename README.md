# JadeMP
an internal minecraft modpack for just some friends. 

##
JadeMP is a Custom (WIP) Modpack for 1.20.1 using Forge.
Mainly created because the current modpacks we had been playing were extremely bloated, difficult to find any other modpack with a similar mod combination to the ones we liked, and that nearly all of them had been stuck in 1.12.2.

## Installation
Create a Minecraft 1.20.1 Forge Install and add the provided mod folder using the following methods

### CurseForge
idfk
### PrismLauncher
* Add Instance
* Custom
* Version 1.20.1
* Mod Loader: Forge
* OK
Now to install JadeMP
* right click on the new instance and open Folder
  > on linux this will be in `~/.var/app/org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher/data/PrismLauncher/instances/`
* unzip archive and paste contents of `mods` in the unzipped archive into `.minecraft/mods`
